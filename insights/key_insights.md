## 1. Revenue is primarily driven by returning customers

### Revenue Breakdown

| Revenue Type | Total Revenue (₹) | Customers | Revenue per Customer (₹) |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| New Customers    | 17.13M          | 29,200     | ~587 |
| Returning Customers | 46.11M       | 26,312    | ~1,752 |


**Key takeaway**
- Returning customers contribute **~73% of total revenue**
- Revenue per returning customer is **~3× higher** than new customers


**Why this matters**
Sustainable growth depends far more on retaining existing customers than
continuously acquiring new users. Any decline in retention would have a
disproportionate impact on topline revenue.


## 2. Customer retention collapses early across all cohorts

### Retention Pattern (Mature Cohorts)

| Lifecycle Stage | Retention Range |
|----------------|----------------|
| Month 1        | ~50–55% |
| Month 3        | ~12–17% |
| Month 6+       | ~4–7% |

**Key takeaway:**  
- Nearly **half of customers churn after Month 1**
- ~80–85% churn by Month 3

**Why this matters:**  
Strong first-order conversion is not translating into habit formation.
