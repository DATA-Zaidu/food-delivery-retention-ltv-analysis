# Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates customer growth quality for a food delivery business by
examining retention, lifetime value (LTV), discount impact, geography, and revenue
composition.

While customer acquisition has scaled significantly, the analysis reveals that
long-term revenue sustainability is driven by a smaller base of retained customers.
Several structural factors — including early churn, discount-led acquisition, and
geographic expansion into lower-value markets — are diluting average customer value
over time.

The findings suggest that future growth should prioritize retention and early
customer engagement rather than pure acquisition volume.
